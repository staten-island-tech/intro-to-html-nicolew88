    <h1>Nicole Wang's About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Nicole Wang. I have no clue what I'm supposed to write in this short paragraph so I'll share some facts. 
        I'm currently a junior who is regretting her life choices from last year (my schedule). I have a younger brother who 
        can't do his own homework without help and a older sister who just started college. I have a horrible sleep schedule which looks
        like there is no hope of fixing this year and I procrastinate way too much. I'm a really picky kid but I've started to have a change
        in my taste buds so I think I'm slowly getting there. Some foods I like are taro, cauliflower, sushi, noodles (I like most noodles), 
        fried rice, and enoki mushrooms. I hate eating cake so on my birthday, so I usually don't eat my birthday cake. However, my parents have
        started getting me ice cream cake instead which is great (and best to eat when it's cold).
    </p>
